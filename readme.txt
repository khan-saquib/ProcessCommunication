List of Files:

1. os.c
This file has the code which implements the project. The code is properly commented and has been run on linux as well as cygwin.


2. program.txt
This file has the sample program that can be run on the code that I developed. It implements a power function.
Input: two numbers a and b.
Output: the value of a^b if it is within int range.
P.S. I am not giving any prompts in the command window. Just enter the first number. Hit enter. Enter the second number and hit enter. The result will be 	displayed in the next line.






How to compile and run your project?
Please make sure that the os.c and program.txt files are in the same directory. You can replace the code in program.txt file with any other code you want to test my code against.
My program has a "No operation instruction" with Instruction Code "0". This is the only instruction I have added to the instruction set that we were asked to support.
